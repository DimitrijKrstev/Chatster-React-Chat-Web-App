# Chatster
Chatster is a real-time chat web app made with React and Firebase. Chatster requires the user to create an account to access the site itself. Upon signing in the user is presented with chatrooms that have been created by other users and is given the option to create one themselves. React ensures fast and real time updates to messages and Firebase  entirely handles user authentication and offers the Realtime database for keeping track of online users and current messages, as well as the Firestore database for user account details and chatroom details.
